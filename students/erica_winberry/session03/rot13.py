# This module should provide at least one function called rot13 that takes 
# any amount of text and returns that same text encrypted by ROT13.

# This function should preserve whitespace, punctuation and capitalization.

# Your module should include an if __name__ == '__main__': block with tests (asserts) 
# that demonstrate that your rot13 function and any helper functions you add work properly.

# There is a “short-cut” available that will help you accomplish this task.
# Some spelunking in the documentation for strings should help you to find it.
# If you do find it, using it is completely fair game.

# As usual, add your new file to your local clone right away. 
# Make commits early and often and include commit messages that are descriptive and concise.

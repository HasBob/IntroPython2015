About the simplest “curve” you can have is a horizontal straight line, 
in this case, at y = 5. The area under that line from 0 to 10 is a 
rectangle that is 10 wide and 5 high, so with an area of 50.

Of course in this case, it’s easiest to simply multiply the height 
times the width, but we want a function that will work for Any curve.

HINT: this simple example could be a good test case!
